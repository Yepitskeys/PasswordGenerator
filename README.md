Project Title: Password Generator

Project Description: The goal of this project was to create a password generator application. Using the provided the CSS, HTML and starter Javascript code, I was able to create a password generator that met the following criteria:

    * When a user clicks the button to generate a password, they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    * When the user is prompted for password criteria, they are able to select which type of characters to include in the password (special characters, numbers, uppercase and lower case letters)
    * When the user generates their password, they are able to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    * When the user generates their password, it will match the criteria they selected, along with their specific length requested.
